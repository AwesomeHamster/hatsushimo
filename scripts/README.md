# Scripts

`*.js` files here are used to ease git-submodules management.
You can use them via `node scripts/<script-name>.js`.
But it is not recommanded to run them by yourself.

## `scripts/push.js`

This script is used to push local changes to remote repositories, including submodules.

You can also type `yarn gp` to use this script because it is written in `package.json`.
