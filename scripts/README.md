`.sh` files here are used to ease git-subtree management. But it is not recommanded to run them by yourself.

## `scripts/init.sh`

Before using these scripts, you should run `scripts/init.sh` to register remote repository to git.

## `scripts/push.sh`

This script is used to push local changes to remote repositories, including subtrees.
